# Song-playing-Bot
Song palying bot using JioSavan.
Commands
1. -play song_name: for playing songs.
2. -next: for playing next song in list.
3. -previous: for playing previous song in list.
4. -stop: for pausing song.
5. -start: for playing paused song.

Note: As JioSavan has updated its Website UI and elements
the bot is not working because the XPATH it was looking for 
pressing buttons on website to perform actions is now changed 
due to UI update. Fixing XPATHs with the current UI of JioSavan 
will make the bot work again.
